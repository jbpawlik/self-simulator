### __Description__
Are you plagued with insecurity, self-doubt, and shame? Have you ever wondered if your mere presence bored and annoyed others? Self Simulator is a proof-of-concept website for an application that allows the user to gain insight into how they come across to others. The user answers a short series of questions, then has their responses returned as though they were in conversation with themselves. This allows the user to assess their conversional prowess, articulation, and erudition. If the user finds that they are lacking, they will have the feedback they need to improve, instead of always wondering, "Why doesn't anyone like me?"

### __Technologies Used__
The Self Simulator website is made in HTML and CSS (using Bootstrap). JavaScript and JQuery were used for the backend and user interface logic. Images for Self Simulator were made in GIMP.
